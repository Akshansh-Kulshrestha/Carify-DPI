Voltage (V),Engine State,Inference,Recommendation
< 11.8 V,Off,Severely discharged battery,Recharge or replace battery immediately
11.8 – 12.0 V,Off,Low battery charge,"Recharge soon, monitor usage"
12.1 – 12.3 V,Off,Partially charged battery,May require charging
12.4 – 12.7 V,Off,Normal resting voltage (healthy battery),NIL
> 12.7 V,Off,Possibly overcharged or surface charge present,Recheck after load applied
13.7 – 14.7 V,On (idling),Normal charging voltage from alternator,NIL
< 13.5 V,On,Weak alternator or poor charging,Check alternator and connections
> 14.8 V,On,Overcharging – regulator or alternator fault possible,Inspect voltage regulator/alternator
